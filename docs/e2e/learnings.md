# E2E Learnings

## Key Findings From E2E Field Mapping

- Not all enumerators are OSM users - we need to adapt accordingly.
- The OSM default of mapping **roof areas** may not be the best approach going forward.
  - We are capable of producing 3D meshes from drone imagery, so the actual **building
    footprint** is now possible.
  - See discussion [here][1].
- Basic use cases should be the default for tool, but there should always be options
  to customise and let advanced users take control.
