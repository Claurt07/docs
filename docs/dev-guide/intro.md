# Development Guide

The HOT Tech Team comprises a dynamic assembly of highly skilled
individuals, each bringing a diverse range of expertise and
backgrounds. United by a shared commitment, our goal is clear:
leveraging technology to contribute to a better world.

The tech team includes a core of software developers who co-develop
many of the tools listed in this documentation index.

There is also a large community of developers who helps to facilitate
this work: from consultants, NGOs, and innovative tech agencies
distributed throughout the world.

The aim of this development guide is twofold:

## Guidelines for Collaborators

Open-source is at the heart of everything we do. In order to collaborate
effectively, it is important to have a set of agreed upon standards and
practices that developers must loosely follow.

## A Resource for New Developers

We encourage new developers to start their open-source contribution
journey with us. We are a welcoming, considerate, and patient bunch.

The consensus-based information here is not an authoritative source
of the only approach to software development.
Nevertheless, we firmly believe that adhering to the recommendations
in this guide will undoubtedly set you on the path to becoming a skilled
software professional, grounded in our collective experiences at HOT.

If these documents help a single new developer on their journey
from coding zero to hero, then it has been a success.
