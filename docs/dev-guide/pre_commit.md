# Pre-Commit Hooks

## Git Hooks

Git has **hooks**, which can run code on various events:

- Prior to commiting code (pre-commit).
- After committing code (post-commit).
- After checking out a branch (post-checkout).
- Before rebasing (pre-rebase).
- Etc.

## Pre-Commit

- Pre-commit Git hooks run checks before a commit is accepted.
- Pre-commit is a package to automate the setup.
- After config, issues such as syntax errors and security flaws are picked up.
- Used mostly for formatting and linting.
- Linting is checking code against a set of formatting rules
  and for syntax errors.
