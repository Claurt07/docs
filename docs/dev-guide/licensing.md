# Licensing

With so many options for licensing code, the topic can be quite confusing.

Simply, at HOT we use two types of license:

## All code is AGPLv3

- This is a strong 'copyleft' licence, meaning that anyone using a modified
  version of our open-source code, **must make their code open too**.
- The main purpose of this license is to prevent commercial exploitation of
  open code, making any modifications open so the entire community can benefit.

## Other Content is CC-BY

- Creative content, such as translations and designs are copyrighted different.
- As with AGPL for code, this license is 'copyleft'
- It allows others modify and built upon our own, even for commercial purposes,
  as long as they **credit us** and
  **license their work under the same terms as CC-BY**.

## What Licenses Can We Use

- We use many underlying packages and tools within our software.
- Any contributor must be aware of licensing before adding any additional
  external code to our software.
