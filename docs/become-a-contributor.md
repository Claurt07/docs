# 🎉 Become a Contributor 🎉

## Background

HOT has a **small** tech team of motivated individuals that work to:

- Develop many different tools you can see in our [Github organization][1]
- Improve accessibility of humanitarian data to the wider community.
- Support field activities for data collection and analysis.

Being quite stretched, we rely heavily on the support of volunteers for all
of the above activities!

## Getting Started

We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels, and we are committed
to making sure your participation is inclusive, enjoyable, and rewarding.

If you have never contributed to an open source project before, we are a good
place to start, and we will make sure you are supported every step of the way.

If you have any questions, please ask our community 😊

## What Can I Help With?

### 🧪 Testing 🧪

We warmly welcome your input in testing our tools and sharing your feedback.

This could be via either:

- User testing: please use our tools and inform us of any errors or issues you
  may encounter.

- Technical testing: if you are a software tester, then improvements to our automated
  testing suite would be greatly appreciated!

Feedback can be given either via the Github repository for the tool, or via our
community discussion channels.

### 👨‍💻 Code 👨‍💻

Contributing code is a certain way to benefit the team and the end-user communities
of our tools!

Please browse our latest task boards, or Github issues, found on the `Projects`
section on this website.

A **pull request** (PR) can be used to solve existing issues on a repository 🙌

If you are wondering where to start, you can filter by the
**good first issue** label.

Skills with the following would be beneficial:

- Python
- FastAPI
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- React
- Docker
- CI/CD workflows

### 📝 Report bugs and suggest improvements 📝

The issue queue for a tool on Github is the best way to get started here.

There are issue templates for BUGs and FEATURES that you can use,
or you could also create your own.

Discussions can also be used to higher level discussions or to ask questions.

### 🔒 Report security vulnerabilities 🔒

Please inform a maintainer as soon as possible, including the CVE code.

Message via the [HOTOSM Slack][2] or [direct email][3] would be preferred,
but via Github issue is also possible.

### 🤝 Thank You 🤝

Thank you very much in advance for your contributions!!

Please ensure you refer to our [Code of Conduct][4].
