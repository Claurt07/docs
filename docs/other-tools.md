## OpenAerialMap (OAM)

![OAM overview][1]

!!! note

    OpenAerialMap was originally developed by HOT in 2015 and has since
    undergone multiple revisions.

    Due to lack of funding, contributors such as Kontur now maintain OAM.

    It is still an important tool in the Open Mapping ecosystem.

## Export Tool

!!! note

    Export Tool currently works fine, using raw-data-api as it's data
    extraction backend.

    However, feature developments are likely paused into the future.
