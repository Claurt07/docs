# HOT Documentation

Project-specific documentation can be found in the docs folder for the
project. This is the home of everything that does not belong to one
specific project. 

Here you can find:
## Learn about the HOT Documentation Approach

### [Technical Documentation Templates](templates/README.md)
Standard documentation templates for HOT technical documentation.

## Learn About the HOT Architecture

### [Overarching Views of the Architecture](overview/README.md)
Architecture views (and other documentation) that is not specific to
one HOTSM application and applicable across multiple or all.


### [The Architecture Decision Log](templates/Decisions.md)
A register of all the key architecture decisions for the HOTSM
ecosystem, including some detail around why each was decided.

### [Risk Log](templates/Risks.md)
A register of all the overarching risks for the HOTSM ecosystem.
