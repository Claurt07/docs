# Use `uv` as our backend dependency manager

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a modern Python package management tool that is:

- Much faster than pip and pip-tools.
- Able to handle lock files and virtual environments cleanly.
- Better at resolving complex dependency trees reproducibly.

## Considered Options

- pip + virtualenv
- pipenv
- poetry
- pdm
- uv

## Decision Outcome

uv (by Astral) was selected for its speed, strict reproducibility,
and modern tooling ergonomics.

It significantly improves dependency resolution times and offers a
seamless developer experience.

Unlike traditional tools like pip, uv performs rapid dependency resolution and installs,
while producing lock files that ensure consistency across platforms and environments.

## Consequences

- ✅ Extremely fast dependency resolution and installation (Rust based).
- ✅ Modern, opinionated tooling with strong defaults.
- ✅ Simplifies management of virtual environments and lock files.
- ✅ Support for workspace packages, to allow for easier monorepo setups.
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem and community support (as of 2025, growing fast!).
- ❌ Requires team familiarity with new workflows.
