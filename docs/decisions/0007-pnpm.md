# Use `pnpm` as our frontend dependency manager

## Context and Problem Statement

In our frontend projects, we need a reliable, efficient, and developer-friendly package
manager for JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies.

Key concerns include:

- Speed and disk usage efficiency.
- Deterministic and reproducible installs.
- Compatibility with existing tools and workflows.
- Minimizing node_modules bloat and install conflicts.

## Considered Options

- npm
- yarn (classic or berry)
- pnpm

Options not considered: package managers used by runtimes other than NodeJS,
such as Deno or Bun.

## Decision Outcome

- pnpm was selected as our default package manager due to its performance benefits,
  disk space efficiency, and strict dependency resolution.
- Compared to npm and yarn, pnpm uses a content-addressable storage system and hard
  links to avoid duplication.
- It also enforces more consistent dependency resolution, helping to catch errors
  early in development.

## Consequences

- ✅ Fast install speeds, especially in CI environments.
- ✅ Reduced disk usage thanks to shared dependency storage.
- ✅ More deterministic builds with stricter dependency isolation.
- ❌ Less familiar for some contributors compared to npm/yarn.
- ❌ Occasional compatibility issues with legacy packages expecting a flat node_modules.
