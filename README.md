This website is an index of tools available from HOT,
and it is primarily intended for a software development audience.

The docs go into specific technical detail for:

- Code structure and higher level overviews to get started.
- Deployment / installation of software tools, including configuration options.
- Options and variables for CLI commands.
- Web API references to better understand expected inputs and responses.
- Library API references for developing against.

Each sidebar item will link to the documentation specific to each repo.

HOT is working towards the modularization of our code to improve
maintainability and implement an end-to-end user flow between multiple
tools. There is more info about [modularization](modules.md) of our code.
