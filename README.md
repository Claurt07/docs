ðŸ•® Welcome to the HOT Technical [documentation](https://hotosm.github.io/docs/)

The docs go into specific technical detail for:

- Code structure and higher level overviews to get started.
- Deployment / installation of software tools, including configuration options.
- Options and variables for CLI commands.
- Web API references to better understand expected inputs and responses.
- Library API references for developing against.
- Info about [modularization](https://hotosm.github.io/docs/modules) of our code.

Each sidebar item will link to the documentation specific to each repo.
